This repository contains publicly-available firmware and CAD files for items in the TakkTile product line, a line of sensitive, easy-to-manufacture tactile sensors.

The TakkArray is a 5x8 I2C-addressable sensor array providing ~1g sensitivity. The ATTINY24A microcontroller is used to multiplex the MPL115A2 sensors. The firmware is written is written in embedded C for the avr-gcc toolchain. The firmware is well commented.

[TakkTile-usb](https://github.com/TakkTile/TakkTile-usb) is the suggested implementation of the USB-I2C bridge, also providing a Python module implementing calibration and compensation routines.
